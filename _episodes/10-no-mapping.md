# Why we shouldn't map Twitter

Let's put a map or a graph here that shows how very few tweets we expect to have a geotag



## very few have geotags
Only a tiny little fraction of tweets have meaningful
and useful geographic information. And even those that have
Twitter's geolocations embedded in them are pretty useless.

### Count the geotagged tweets in one of our sets

## Even fewer have a specific intentional location
### Count the POINT geotagged tweets in one of our sets




The exercise here will be to show GitHub's ability to map a twitter dataset.
