# Let's Get Ethical




> ## Challenge: January 6 Insurrectionists
>
> After the US Capitol riot, a user on kaggle captured 80,000
> Tweets from people associated with that day's events, concentrating
> on accounts from those protesting / rioting.
> 
> This kaggle user, in the public interest, stored the full content of
> these Tweets as a .csv. The best practice would be to save only a 
> dehydrated set of tweets. However, in this instance, we can use this 
> person's conscientious objection to the rules to be a public good.
>
> Using the file "dehydrated_Capitol_Rioters.txt", determine how many
> Tweets were in the archive, and how many remain on Mr. Musk's new
> acquisition. 
>
> ```
>
> > ## Solution
> > On first run through, only 10 of the first 999 tweets remain.
> >
> > This indicates that a huge proportion of this dataset has
> > been deleted or restricted by Twitter.
