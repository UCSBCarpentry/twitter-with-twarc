## Misinformation

Something about social media as a tool for people with certain motives. 
I wonder if theres a Parler Dataset on Kaggle? Or do you think that might violate the Carpentries code of conduct (too risky?)? 

> ## Challenge: January 6 Insurrectionists
>
> After the US Capitol riot, a user on kaggle captured 80,000
> Tweets from people associated with that day's events, concentrating
> on accounts from those protesting / rioting.
> 
> This kaggle user, in the public interest, stored the full content of
> these Tweets as a .csv. The best practice would be to save only a 
> dehydrated set of tweets. However, in this instance, we can use this 
> person's conscientious objection to social norms and Twitter's
> Terms-of-Service to ask whether or not any of this is in the
> public good or an acceptable topic of research.
>
> Using the file [dehydrated_Capitol_Rioters.txt](../data/dehydratedCapitolRiotTweets.txt), determine how many
> Tweets were in the archive, and how many remain on Mr. Musk's new
> acquisition. 
> {: .source}

> > ## Solution
> > On first run through, only 10 of the first 999 tweets remain.
> > This indicates that a huge proportion of this dataset has
