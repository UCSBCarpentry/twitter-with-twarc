# Learning to Speak Twitter

If you've never used Twitter before, the language used, in addition to 
being NSFW, can be totally cryptic. Beyond "@ing people" and 
"hashtags", the users themselves have created Twitter-wide standards, and
Twitter is also filled with subcommunities who use their own 
lingo.

Twitter has its own <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/resources/twitter-guide/twitter-101/speak-the-language-of-twitter-twitter-help">getting started guide</a>

> ## Challenge
Throw a few terms into the etherpad

This is a not too awful guide:

# API: A Complicated Topic and a (mostly) Easy Tool

API is an abbreviation that stands or Application Programming Interface. It allows computers or applications to communicate with one another without requiring users to code operations from scratch. APIs allow you to use abstraction, because similar to how you don't need to know the engineering behind your shower in order to use it, you don't need to understand the code behind APIs in order to fetch data. 

Formally defined, an API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects used by programmers to create software or to interact with external system.

## Common Analogy

Imagine yourself sitting at a table in a restaurant. The waiter comes to your table and you order from a set list of items on the menu. The waiter then takes your order to the chef/kitchen crew who put together different meals and drinks for your table. The waiter then takes your order to your table. 

Here are the key players in our analogy:
1. Customer - you as the user
2. Menu items - the commands and operations you can pass to an API in order to retrieve information
3. Waiter - the API that delivers your information request to the system, and then your resulting dataset to you 
4. Chef/Kitchen crew - the external program or webserver that has the information you seek

## Callout
**APIs shouldn't be confused with webscraping.**


# Twarcing

You may be asking, "What is twarc?" or, "Why do all things involving Twitter have to start with a 'tw'?".
