# Learning to Speak Twitter

If you've never used Twitter before, the language used, in addition to 
being NSFW, can be totally cryptic. Beyong "atting people" and 
"hashtags", the users themselves have created Twitter-wide standards, and
Twitter is also filled with subcommunities who use their own 
lingo.

Twitter has its own getting started guide,
