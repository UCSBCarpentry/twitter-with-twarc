**This lesson is headed towards The Carpentries Incubator!**
Initial runs of this lesson will happen at UCSB in May 2022.

A member of the [Carpentries Curriculum Team](https://carpentries.org/team/)
will work with you to get your lesson listed on the
[Community Developed Lessons page][community-lessons]
and make sure you have everything you need to begin developing your new lesson.

## What to do next

(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xz6qFmgZOjjzqWy_YsWvxRfuKxbd3V2aLElS4m1ZIcU/edit?usp=sharing)
- Claim an episode Jira ticket if you feel a lesson is ready to be moved over and
