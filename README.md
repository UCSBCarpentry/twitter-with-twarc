[![Create a Slack Account with us](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_Slack_Account-The_Carpentries-071159.svg)](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)

We've moved this over to the Incubator!

A Data Carpentry style 5 hour workshop on harvesting and analyzing Twitter data using the public API and Documenting the Now's Twarc package. The lesson 
makes a very natural add-on and reinforcement to BASH and Intro to Python.

## Black Lives Matter
twarc is a tool created by [Documenting the Now](https://docnow.io), born of the 
civil unrest following the murder of Michael Brown by police in 2014.

## What to do next

- ** UCSB team: ** Complete the post-workshop run-through shortening the folder names and fixing obvious mistakes.
- ** anyone: ** Have at it. Make issues. Give feedback. Teach the lesson. Submit pull requests.

There's still a little Carpentry advice:
* [ ] [Add relevant topic tags to your lesson repository][cdh-topic-tags].
* [*] Consult the [Lesson Example][lesson-example] website to find out more about
