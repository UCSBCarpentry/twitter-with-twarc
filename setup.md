### Getting the Necessary Credentials

Generally, we would call this 'getting your API key', but like many API's the process of getting access to the guts of Twitter has 
become a complicated process. 

You will need: 
* Twitter Account: Valid email account and cell phone number
* Developer Account: You must create the twitter account to link to the Developer account first. 
  You can create a developer account [here](developer.twitter.com/en)
  - The developer is particular about having a valid phone number, add one to your Twitter account if you haven't yet
  - Fill out the Application questions as listed: 
	-
