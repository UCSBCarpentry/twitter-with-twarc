## twarc

twarc is a command line tool and Python library that is used to harvest and archive Tweets through the Twitter API. 
The great thing about twarc is that it’s accessible, free, and fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. 
It’s also an active open-source project (that means it is essentially open to collaboration and use by anyone) and is well-documented on Github by an organization referred to as Documenting the Now.

### Black Lives Matter and Documenting the Now
This lesson will introduce you to a Python application called twarc. twarc was created 
by [Document the Now](https://docnow.io) during the civil unrest in Ferguson, 
Missouri following [the shooting and killing of Michael
Brown, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown) by a police officer.
Document the Now develops open source tools and community centered practices that support the ethical collection, use, and preservation
of publicly available content shared on the web and social media. 


### This lesson is being prepared for UCSB Carpentries
After an initial run-through, we will submit this lesson to the
Carpentries Incubator. We Carpentry practice what we Carpentry
preach. Feel free to jump in.
