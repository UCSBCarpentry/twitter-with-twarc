## twarc
### Black Lives Matter
This lesson will introduce you to a Python application called twarc. twarc was created 
by [Document the Now](https://docnow.io), which itself was born during the civil unrest in Ferguson, 
Missouri after [the shooting and killing of Michael
Brown, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown) by a police officer.

twarc is used to harvest Twitter data.

### This lesson is being prepared for UCSB Carpentries
After an initial run-through, we will submit this lesson to the
Carpentries Incubator. We Carpentry practice what we Carpentry
preach. Feel free to jump in.
