# ep 2 Getting familiar with JupyterLab

* After configuring twarc in jupyterlab, helpers can help struggling learners on the twarc2 
  configuration while the instructor may go over the remaining episode content.
* We've written the lesson using @ecodatascience as the  solution to the '2 Timelines' 
  so if you do that as an instructor, subsequent code should run as is.

# Code
* In the Jupyter Notebook that we have shared, calls that use quota to the 
  Twitter v2 api are commented out.
